Films
-----

Students view one feature-length, or at most, one feature-length and one short film per week by Spanish film director Luis Buñuel, that is, 13 out of Buñuel's total production of 32 films. The course includes roughly two and a half hours per week of discussion about the films and related web materials and printed texts, including film criticism and the director's autobiography _Mi último suspiro_. The subject considers films spanning Buñuel's entire career, from his earliest silent surrealist classic of 1929 to his last film,_Cet Obscur object du désir_ (_Ese oscuro objeto del deseo_, 1977), although it pays special attention to his Mexican period and the three films he made in Spain.

The subject also explores Buñuel's early friendship with painter Salvador Dalí and poet Federico García Lorca, surrealist aesthetics, the influence in his films of Freud's ideas on dreams and sexuality, his corrosive criticism of bourgeois society and the Catholic church, and allusions to European painting (i.e. Dalí, Vermeer, Ribera, Millet) in his cinematic images. Historical contextualization will be provided for each film discussed.
